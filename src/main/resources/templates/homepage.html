<h1>WELCOME TO</h1>
<h1>Fire Emblem Demo</h1>
<h2>A Fire Emblem simulator demo, to try Levels and Weapons with Fighters</h2>
<h2>---------------------------------------------------------------------</h2>
<p>This was a demo proyect made by Esteban Bedecarats</p>
<p>The "game" consists of choosing two warriors and make them fight to death</p>
<p>The winner will level up, the looser will level down</p>
<p>Levels grant additional Health, Attack and Defense points</p>
<p>Another point to consider are the Weapons, where are many but only 3 types:</p>
<p>You need to know this:</p>
<p>-Swords beat Axes but they are weak against Spears</p>
<p>-Axes beat Spears but they are weak against Swords</p>
<p>-Spears beat Swords but they are weak against Axes</p>
<p>To start, press the "Start" button which will lead to the warriors selection screen</p>
